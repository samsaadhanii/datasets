## Frequencies

Here is a list of frequency files generated during the alignment of the DCS Corpus and Heritage Segmenter.

There are five files:

1. "comp\_freq.tsv" -> list of frequencies for compound components
2. "comp\_trans\_freq.tsv" -> list of frequencies for sandhi within compound words
3. "pada\_freq.tsv" -> list of frequencies for words
4. "pada\_trans\_freq.tsv" -> list of frequencies for sandhi across words
5. "word\_freq.tsv" -> list of frequencies for words (both words and compound components)
